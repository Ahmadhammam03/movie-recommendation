# Models Directory

This directory will contain trained model files after running the training pipeline.

## Generated Files:
- `best_sae_model.pth` - Best model weights during training
- `experiment_results.json` - Training metrics and results
- Custom model saves with timestamps

## Usage:
```python
# Save model
experiment.save_model("my_sae_model.pth")

# Load model  
experiment.load_model("my_sae_model.pth")
```

*This .gitkeep file ensures the models/ directory exists in git while ignoring large model files.*
